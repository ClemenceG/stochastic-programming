# Optimization Projects Repository

Welcome to the Optimization Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of various optimization projects implemented in different programming languages.

## Overview

This repository is organized into subdirectories, each housing a distinct optimization project. These projects cover a wide range of optimization techniques, including:

- **Project 1**: 2-step Newsvendor problem with varying random scenarios, result reproduction for “The value of the right distribution in stochastic programming with application to a Newsvendor problem” (Maggioni, et al., 2019)
- **Project 2**: Result reproduction of "Sample Average Approximation Method for Chance Constrained Programming : Theory and Applications” with https: //www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset

''' Each project directory includes its own README and code, providing detailed information on the optimization technique, its implementation, and how to run or use the code.'''
